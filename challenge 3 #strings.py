 ###Pig Latin takes the first consonant of a word,
    moves it to the end of the word 
    and adds on an “ay”. 
    If a word begins with a vowel you just add “way”
    to the end. For example, pig becomes igpay, 
    banana becomes ananabay, and
    aadvark becomes aadvarkway. 
    Create a program that will ask the
    user to enter a word and change it into Pig Latin. 
    Make sure the new word is displayed in lower case.
